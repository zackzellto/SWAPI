## Usage

1. In the search bar, type the full name or any alpha-numeric character of the Star Wars character that you would like to retrieve data on.
2. The application will retrieve the specified data from the external API in use and display it on the table according to the search results found.
3. If it is a specific character, the application will display solely that output, if it is a alpha-numeric character the application will display all chracters that have the specific search input.
4. If there are many options being displayed there is a pagination bar that will allow you to jump to a specific page of data, or you can sift through or go back via the "Prev" and "Next" buttons.

Hope you enjoy using the Star Wars API search application!
